    The existing product which can share food with each other mostly focus on charity, such as providing poor people with food. And a small part of websites mainly help selling home-made food. Our product focuses on “share”. Our product will focus on people don’t know how to cook or people don’t have time to cook. If you are a student who do bad on cooking and there is a family making to much food tonight, you can visit the family and enjoy a free meal, or may you need some trade-back for this meal(like clean the kitchen). Our competitors don’t focus on this field may due to they don’t realize that a large part of students don’t know how to cook and a lot of college-student don’t have enough time to cook by themselves because of assignments and deadlines.
