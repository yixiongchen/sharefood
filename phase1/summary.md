Objective:
We want to build an web-based application that helps those with difficulty cooking healthy meals. The application will connect people, good samaritans, that are willing to cook for free or small fee to help those in need of a healthy meal. 

Key Personas:
- Justin, an international student who is in his third year of computer science. He has many classes to go to, as well as a huge amount of homework. He craves homemade food but he doesn’t know how to cook that well. 
- Jenny, who is a single mother juggling her time between two jobs and her kid. She tries her best to cook healthy meals for her kid but there are many occasions she doesn’t have time to do so. 
- John, a retired chef who loves to cook and to help out with those that are in need. He wants to help but he doesn’t know exactly where to start.

Key Scenarios:
- John’s son helped him to register on the site. Jenny who is already registered realized today she doesn’t have to buy groceries to cook for his son. She goes on the application and finds that John is available to today. She connects with John to place an order for dinner for two. John accepts it and later they enjoy a healthy meal together. 
- After an mid-term test today, Justin simply doesn’t want to eat take-out food anymore. He goes on the app and chooses Chinese food category, it turns out to be John who is cooking again. This time, John feels like some of the seafood he bought was a little bit expensive, so he decides to add a charge of $5 to this meal. Justin figures that $5 isn’t too bad so he connects with John. 

Key Principle:
- At this stage, the speed of the communication between the consumer and the provider is our main focus. This is accomplished by using simplistic and basic designs that at the same time also doesn’t sacrifice usage. 

Extra notes/scope:
For the MVP of this course, we feel like implementing only sharing/providing food is the most realistic goal. However, the complete product can be expanded to sharing/selling household products somewhat similar to an online flee market but preferably for the purpose helping out other people and not for profiting.
