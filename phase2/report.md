Initial Planning:
    Scrum Master:
	- Somebody who brings the team together to complete tasks and 		facilitates the meeting time and location to accommodate all team 		members
	- During the meeting, takes note of/bring up issues/tasks that are 		incomplete
	- Task distribution and adjustment
	- Make sure the team is on track to complete target. 
	- In our team, everybody contributed to the role of the scrum master. 
	- Meeting times and locations were decided in group chats. If a 		certain time is not ideal for many people (e.g. because of a test), 		then a new time is suggested. 
	- Meeting location is always at BA for in-person-meetings and smaller 	meetings are done in group chat (WeChat). 
	- In the beginning, everybody got a part of the application to build, 	but we realized many parts are dependent on other parts to be 		completed first. Therefore, we re-organized into smaller groups (2 		people), if a group is closer to finishing their task and no longer 		needs two people, then a person will go help another group or prepare 	for the next task. 
	- At the end of each coding session, everybody will discuss what 		still needs to be finished for their corresponding part and will 		decide the task to do for the next session.

    Estimating task size:
	- Since all the members in the group are new to Ruby on Rails (or web 	programming), we are pretty much on the same page.
	- In the beginning, we didn’t know the difficult of each task so 		everything was considered as a small task. 
	- As we progressed, if anybody is having trouble completing a 		specific task in a session and even with other people’s help, we 		would elevate that to a medium task. Large tasks would be categorized 	as tasks that took more than one session.  
	- Therefore, all tasks were categorized based on the time it takes 		instead of lines of code. The reason for that is some times a short 		code could be more difficult than a longer piece of code. 
	- More specifically, creating a static page is S, creating a dynamic 	page (ones that takes inputs and such) is M, and the process of 		linking each pages is L. 

Spring Backlog:
- For phase 2, we want to build the basic structure of our web 		application for Food Share. This includes basic login/registration 		function, meal posting, and meal browsing/reservation. Only minimal 		UI is to be implemented. The basic idea is that at the end of phase 		2, our application would be usable with all the basic functions.
 
- As mentioned previously, all members were new to Ruby On Rails the 	first task for everybody was to complete tutorial exercises found 		online to grasp the basic understanding of web programming using 		Rails.
- Based on each member’s completion speed of the tutorials, whoever 		finishes it first would take on the first task.

- The team decided to complete the basic pillars of the application 		first, more specifically, a user and a post class and their 			corresponding attributes. Then, the dynamic functions related to each 	class, for example login or posting. Finally, linking the two classes 	together will be the final task. 

- Github issues were not used, because since we are learning Ruby On 	Rails together, we decided to do all the coding sessions in person. 		We feel like since our questions and answers can be understood easier 	if we are talking face to face rather than using WeChat or Skype. 		Also, since we are starting this phase rather late, because of 		midterms, we feel like face to face sessions help to keep us focused. 	Because we are doing in person coding sessions, if anybody has a 		problem everybody can help to fix that problem so when we commit at 		the end of the session, there are no issues except for incomplete 		parts of the tasks, and everybody is aware of these incomplete parts. In this phase we were lucky that everybody finished midterms around 	the same time so we all had the same availabilities and we could all 	meet up in person. However, in the future when members cannot show up to in-person-sessions, github issues will definitely be used for communicating problems with their code. 

Update Meetings:
1. Oct 21st, 1 hr at BA, all members
- Decided to use Ruby On Rails to build our app. 
- Found tutorials online to help each member learn RoR
- Discussed the sprint backlog

2. Oct 23rd, 10 min on WeChat, all members
- Checking progress on each member and see if a session can be started within the next few days. 
- Result: everybody started but is not where close to finish, as well as busy with assignments and midterms, little progress has been made on the tutorial so the first coding session is postponed until midterms end. 
- Ensured each member to start the tutorial ASAP.

3. Oct 27th, 10 min on WeChat, Jack and Danny
- Confirms that the first coding session will begin on Oct 29th for two members. 
- The rest will start the day after. 

4. Oct 28th, 3 hrs at BA, Jack and Danny
- Meeting plus coding session. 
- Building the user class

5. Oct 29th, 3 hrs at BA, all members
- Meeting/coding session
- Finishing up tutorials and splitting tasks between members.

6. Oct 30th, ~6 hrs at BA, all members
- Coding session
- Two people implementing user, two people on posts and one person on login

7. Oct 31st, ~6 hrs at BA, all members
- Coding session
- Change plan to one person finishing up user, two people finishing up posts, and two people on login. 

8. Nov 1st, ~8 hrs at BA, all members
- Jack and Justin trying to link user and posts, Tony finishing up login, Danny and Charlie creating report.md


Burndown Chart:
User - 25%
Post - 25%
Login/linking - 25%
Online tutorial - 15%
Report - 10%

Since in the beginning, we valued each task to be the same size (because we don’t actually know how hard each of them is), towards the end Login/linking probably takes up 40% of the work because User and Post very close to completion a few days earlier. 

We planned to count one hour of work as one percent of work completion. 
However, the quantity of work done really depended on how the coder feels; we try to make each finished functionality 1-2% of completed work. 

Please check Burndown.pdf in the same folder as this file for the charts.

Review & Retrospective:
1. 
a) One main functionality that we did not complete was linking each post to each corresponding user, so there are no organized way to view a user’s posting history. We do not really know why so we will have to spend more time to learn this functionality. 
b) Completing Login functions were split to have two people working on it since it’s a little more complicated, also because User is close to completion. 
2. 
a) We feel like having in-person coding sessions definitely work well for us, because we are able to help each other directly and if somebody has a problem, help can be provided right away. We will try to do as much of group coding sessions as possible
b) We should’ve used Github more efficiently. We didn’t use issues, but it could’ve made checking our progress much simpler, where each completed/uncompleted is an issue. 
c) We need to manage our time better because towards the end of the 14 days we were cramming to finish. We should’ve started a few days earlier as well to avoid the midterm week. We also need to be more organized on Github, provide comments/issues and commit more often.
