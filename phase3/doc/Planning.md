We aim to build a charitable website for people to share their homemade food with others. For example, on the one hand, some people who have enough time to cook by themselves and love to help others could post their addresses and the meal they would cook on our ‘Food sharing’ website. On the other hand, the people who have no time to cook by themselves or cannot afford their meal could book their meal nearby online. 

The specific assignments for phase 3
- link to Goole Maps, then the customers could find the location of food posters directly
- improve ‘food posting’ page, so that customers could search a food type they like
- add mail box, so that chefs and customers could communicate with each other conveniently
- link post to user
add status and reserve button, initialising a integer to record the maximum number of people for a meal, which would decrease if the meal is reserved by customers
- picture posting, people are able to set up user profile and post the picture of their food
- improve UI

We finished all works in our plan. We had some troubles in setting up search page and linking to Google Maps but we solved our problems eventually. In the future, we would improve our UI (e.g. the posting page and website style), cancelation feature (for example, people cannot cancel their reservation within the last hour before the meal) and the most important work we are going to do—security problem (For now, people could modify others basic information and posts).
