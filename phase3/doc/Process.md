1.November 16, Monday, BA3200 (1 hour meeting )
This was the first meeting for phase3, we talked about the new features which we were planning to add on our MVP. We did not know ruby-on-rails very well, especially, we did not understand how class and function actually work in ruby on rails and how the database save the data such as serialization. Thus our priority was to get used to ruby on rails, and we chose The Rail on Rails Tutorial as our learning material. 

2.November 17, Tuesday, WeChat(Online) ( 10 minutes meeting)
Charlie suggested map insertion in our map would be convenient for our users to find meals. We decided to apply this feature in our app. 

3.November 19, Thursday, BA3200 (30 minutes meeting and 3 hour coding )
We started coding, in order to improve our MVP, we decided to add new feasible features in our web application. Firstly, every user of our app has authority to reserve an order which is posted by other users on the user interface. Our teammate Danny was responsible to write code for this feature. Secondly, another feature was to insert Google Map in our web app. The google map would automatically locate user position and navigate the destination of location food provider. This was awesome, and Charlie would do it. Then, Jack would do database work and tried to figure out the relationship between Microposts and Users. Lastly, Justin would work on the creating of new feature FoodType including Chinese, Vegetarian etc, so users would have more choices on food. Tony would create new feature called Mail Box where users can write comments on users and also provide suggestion for us. 

4.November 20, Friday, BA3175 (30 minutes meeting and 5 hour coding)
We encountered a lout of problems. Google map need specific API, and Charlie found it could not match with interface because of code errors. Charlie tried inserted API Javascript code into ruby on rails file system and kept testing it in order to make it work properly. Jack and Danny had problems when set new attributes for class Microposts and Users. Database can not initialize attribute as array, so they tried find another way to set attribute as a array. Tony almost finish his Mail Box, but there were still some bugs. Justin finished coding of new class FoodType, but it still need to be tested in order to merge with current version successfully.

5. November 21, Saturday, 750 Bay St(Danny’s Home) (30 minutes meeting and 4 hour coding)
Charlie figured out Map API problem and got the credential from google, the map could locate user’ position on the main page. It was a big success for us. Jack and Danny solved the problem of attribute, they found solution on StackOverFlow that array is supposed set as serialization in the model file. Justin helped Tony on the insertion of picture for users and food. The new version of app worked partly properly, but we had problems when we pushed new version to Github. We spent much time on solving conflicts between forks and locals.

6.November 22, Sunday,  750 Bay St(Danny’s Home) (10 minutes meeting and 5 hour coding)
Danny and Jack worked on the UI improvement, Tony and Justin Fixed the bugs and errors. Charlie was working on writing report. The final version of our app work perfectly
